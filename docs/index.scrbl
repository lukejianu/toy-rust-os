@title{Toy Rust OS Documentation}

This site contains documentation for the
@hyperlink[@github-repo]{toy-rust-os}
project. This project is an attempt to systematically design and
implement a toy operating system in the Rust programming language.
We are currently in the very early stages, still deciding
on the scope of the project.

This document is itself written using
@hyperlink["https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html"]{Scribble}, a
Racket DSL for writing documentation.
You can see its source at
@hyperlink[@github-docs-path]{@github-docs-path},
starting with the @filepath{index.scrbl} file.
